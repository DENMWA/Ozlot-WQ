Ξ-Matrix Engine: Feature Layer Summary (ML-Only Version)

Included Layers (λ₁–λ₁₅):
──────────────────────────
λ₁  - Variance: Statistical spread of drawn numbers
λ₂  - Standard Deviation: Draw dispersion from the mean
λ₃  - Normalized Mean: Draw center normalized by max ball value (47)
λ₄  - Sum of Gaps: Total gap between sorted numbers
λ₅  - Redundancy Penalty: Penalizes repeated digits in set
λ₆  - Maximum Gap (Momentum): Largest jump between any two numbers
λ₇  - Normalized Total: Sum of numbers normalized over draw range
λ₈  - Randomized Weight 1: Controlled entropy injection
λ₉  - Randomized Weight 2: Further stochastic signal
λ₁₀ - Gap Std Deviation: Spread of jump distances
λ₁₁ - ML Prediction Score: Injected from trained model (Division hit likelihood)
λ₁₂–λ₁₅ - Random Modulators: Simulate nonlinear chaos/quantum jitter

Excluded Layer:
──────────────────────────
λ₁₆ - Hilbert Similarity (Quantum Layer): Removed for compatibility and stability.

Core Components:
──────────────────────────
